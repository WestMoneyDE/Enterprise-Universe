## 🎬 HAUPT-PROMPTS (60 Sekunden)

### PROMPT 1: "THE FUTURE OF LIVING" (Flagship)
```
Cinematic aerial shot descending through clouds at golden hour, revealing a stunning modern smart home with floor-to-ceiling windows in a German suburban landscape. The camera smoothly transitions inside, following streams of glowing purple (hex #8b5cf6) and cyan (hex #00f0ff) light particles flowing through the walls, representing the West Money OS neural network.

A elderly woman in a wheelchair smoothly navigates through automatically opening doors, lights adjusting perfectly to her presence. Her family watches via holographic display. The camera pulls back through the window, rising to show multiple smart buildings across a cityscape, all connected by flowing light streams converging at a floating "W" logo.

Style: Ultra-realistic, cinematic 4K, Blade Runner meets Apple commercial aesthetic. Warm golden light mixed with cool tech accents. Smooth dolly movements, lens flares, shallow depth of field.

Text overlay at end: "WEST MONEY OS - The Future of Building Automation"

### PROMPT 2: "CONNECTED ECOSYSTEM" (Tech Focus)
```
Start with extreme close-up of a circuit board, camera slowly pulling back to reveal it transforming into the LOXONE Miniserver. Golden electrical pulses travel along circuit paths. The pulses form the shape of a house, then expand outward.

Transition to split-screen showing simultaneous control: lighting adjusting in a living room, blinds lowering in an office, temperature changing in a senior care facility, security cameras activating at a commercial building. All screens connected by flowing cyan data streams.

The camera zooms out to reveal a futuristic holographic control dashboard floating in space, with the West Money OS interface. A hand reaches into frame, interacting with the hologram, each touch sending ripples of purple light.

Final shot: Multiple floating screens showing HubSpot, WhatsApp, Zadarma, Verisure logos orbiting the central "W" logo like planets around a sun.

Style: High-tech visualization, Matrix meets Minority Report. Deep blacks with vibrant neon accents. Smooth camera movements, particle effects, holographic interfaces.

### PROMPT 3: "ACCESSIBILITY FIRST" (Emotional/Human)
```
Dawn light filtering through smart glass windows that automatically adjust opacity. An elderly man wakes up, and the room gently illuminates to his preferred morning setting. Voice command in German: "Guten Morgen" - the blinds raise, coffee machine starts, news appears on a wall display.

His daughter, 40s, checks on him via smartphone app from her car across the city. She sees his morning routine progressing normally. A notification appears: "Medication reminder sent."

Cut to a wheelchair-accessible bathroom where handrails have integrated sensors, lighting automatically brightens, and a subtle chime confirms safety systems are active.

Final scene: The man video-calling his granddaughter, who waves from the screen while the smart home operates seamlessly in the background. Camera slowly pulls back through the window, revealing the neighborhood at golden hour.

Style: Warm, emotional, documentary-feel with cinematic lighting. Terrence Malick meets Apple "Shot on iPhone" aesthetic. Natural movements, golden hour lighting, intimate moments.

## 🎯 KURZ-PROMPTS (15-30 Sekunden)

### PROMPT 4: "LOGO REVEAL" (Intro/Outro)
```
Dark void with floating particles. A single point of purple light appears in the center. The light pulses, sending waves of energy outward. From the waves, geometric shapes begin forming - circuit patterns, house silhouettes, connection nodes.

The elements converge, rotating and assembling into the "W" logo. As the logo solidifies, it transitions from wireframe to solid form, glowing with a gradient from purple (#8b5cf6) to cyan (#00f0ff). Light explodes outward.

Text fades in below: "WEST MONEY OS" in clean sans-serif, followed by "The Future of Building Automation"

Style: Abstract, premium tech reveal. Similar to Tesla or SpaceX announcement videos. Deep blacks, vibrant accent colors, particle physics, smooth animation.
```

---

### PROMPT 5: "SMART HOME TRANSFORMATION"
```
Time-lapse of a traditional German house exterior, day transitioning to night. As darkness falls, the house begins to glow from within with intelligent lighting. Windows illuminate sequentially in a choreographed pattern.

Security cameras subtly deploy, solar panels adjust angle, smart blinds lower in perfect synchronization. The house appears to "wake up" as a living, breathing entity.

Final frame: House fully illuminated with purple and cyan accent lighting visible through windows, appearing futuristic while maintaining traditional German architecture.

Style: Architectural visualization meets sci-fi. Clean, precise movements, dramatic lighting transitions.
```

---

### PROMPT 6: "DATA FLOW" (Abstract)
```
Abstract visualization of data flowing through a network. Start with a single glowing node, representing a sensor. The node emits particles that travel along invisible pathways, connecting to other nodes - each representing different smart home components.

The network expands into a 3D web, pulsing with information. Color coding: Purple for commands, cyan for sensor data, green for security, orange for energy. All streams converge at a central hub displaying the West Money OS interface.

Zoom into the interface, showing real-time metrics, graphs updating, and notification badges appearing.

Style: Information beautiful / data visualization aesthetic. Clean white or dark background, flowing particle streams, holographic UI elements.
```

## 🏢 BRANCHEN-SPEZIFISCH

### PROMPT 7: "PFLEGEHEIM DER ZUKUNFT" (Healthcare)
```
Sunrise over a modern German senior care facility (Seniorenheim). Camera glides through automatic entrance doors into a bright, welcoming lobby where digital signage displays resident information.

Follow a caregiver through corridors where lighting adjusts to optimal levels. She checks a tablet showing health metrics from room sensors. In a resident's room, ambient lighting creates a calming atmosphere, and a subtle alert notifies staff of medication time.

Evening scene: Common area with seniors enjoying activities, smart environmental controls maintaining perfect comfort. Security systems monitoring discreetly.

Final shot: Aerial view of the facility at blue hour, lights in every room creating a warm, connected community.

Style: Healthcare commercial aesthetic - warm, professional, reassuring. Soft lighting, calm movements, human-centered technology.
```

### PROMPT 8: "BAUTRÄGER VISION" (B2B/Developer)
```
Architect's desk with blueprints that transform into 3D holographic building plans. Camera tracks through the hologram, showing integrated smart systems - HVAC zones, lighting circuits, security networks.

Transition to construction site where workers install smart infrastructure. Fast-forward to completed building with residents moving in, immediately enjoying automated comfort.

Split screen comparing: Traditional building management (chaos, paper, phone calls) vs. West Money OS dashboard (clean, organized, real-time data).

Final frame: Multiple building developments on a map, all connected to central management system.

Style: Professional B2B commercial. Clean, efficient, data-driven. Blue-chip corporate aesthetic with tech innovation overlay.

## 🎮 GAMING/METAVERSE CROSSOVER

### PROMPT 9: "GOD MODE ACTIVATED" (For GTz/Gaming Audience)
```
First-person perspective entering a virtual reality space. The environment transforms from gaming arena (neon grids, floating platforms) into a futuristic smart home.

Player's hands (VR controllers visible) interact with holographic controls - each gesture triggering real-world effects. Lights change, music plays, temperature adjusts. The boundaries between game and reality blur.

"GOD MODE" text appears in fiery Dragon Ball Z style energy effects, transforming into "GOD BOT ULTIMATE" - the AI assistant awakens as a helpful digital companion.

Final transition: VR headset removed, revealing the actual smart home responding to commands made in the virtual space.

Style: Gaming/Esports production aesthetic. High energy, neon colors, particle effects, dramatic reveals. Cyberpunk meets Dragon Ball Z energy effects.
